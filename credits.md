# Inspiration

Kens Labyrinth.

# Art

Many sprites are from the DCSS game. They have been upscaled using [ScalePix](https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/tools/scalepix.html)

The font used is [BitPortion Medium](https://www.1001fonts.com/bitpotion-font.html) by JoebRogers.

The sound is created using [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/).

# Used Code

The engine used is Bevy. Note that care has been used to make the graphics feel old-school. This game is by no means a demonstration of the graphics quality of Bevy.

* I use the fastrand crate.
* UI is inspired by [@jacques-dev on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOl-kacs8TQ))
